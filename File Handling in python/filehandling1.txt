Python can be used to perform various opertaion into the file such as reading and writing into or from the file
There are two types of files:
Text files and Binary files;

#basic sytax :

 f= open("File_name","mode")
 
 here :
 (1) file_name - we have to write the complete file name 
 example - sample.Text
 (2) mode - specify the mode such as read mode or write mode

#lets understand the various modes in which file can be used :

 (1)'r' - THIS MODE OPENS THE FILE FOR READING(DEFAULT)
 (2)'w' - THIS MODE OPENS THE FILE AUTOMATICALLY EVEN IF IT NOT EXISTS FOR WRITING,DELETING A PART INTO THE FILE(TRUNCATING INTO THE FILE)
 (3)'x' - THIS MODE CREATES A NEW FILE AND OPEN IT FOR WRITING
 (4)'a' - THIS MODE OPEN A FILE FOR WRITING,APPENDING TO THE END OF THE FILE IF IT EXISTS
 (5)'b' - THIS MODE OPEN THE FILE IN BINARY MODE
 (6)'t' - THIS MODE OPEN THE FILE IN TEXT MODE
 (7)'+' - THIS MODE OPENS A DISK FILE FOR UPDATING(READING AND WRITING ) 

 NOTE:
 (i) THE 'w' mode allows us to write the data into the file but it overwrites the entire file
    in simple words , the old data in the file is deleted and the new data is added 
 (ii) THE 'a' mode allowd us to write into the file without overwrting the data and adding the 
      new data at the end of the file.
 (iii) THE 'r+' mode allows us to read and overwrite into the file from the starting of the file 
 (iv) IF we open a file in 'w+' mode and then read the file it will return empty as 'w+' mode will
      truncate the old data and the file will be empty
 (v) If we open the file in 'a+' mode the pointer will be placed at the end of the file hence if we try
     to read into the file first the output will be empty hecne we have to seek(0) the pointer and then read,
   you can directly write into the file as it will append the data at the end of the file.


#Deleting a file using FILE I/O:
--> Deleting a file in python cannot be done directly , we have to import some modules to delete the file.
--> Modules are file written by another programmer that generally has a function that we can use.
--> In File I/O we use the os module which is pre-installed into python
