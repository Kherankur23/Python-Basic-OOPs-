OOPS {Obejct Oriented Programming}:
@OOPS consists of the following characterstics :

-->class: Class can be defined as a blueprint for creating objects.They can alsp be defined as the combination of methods and attirbutes/variables
-->Object : They are defined inside the class, also called as instances.
-->Abstraction : This can be defined as the way of hiding unnecessary data from the user
-->Encapsulatoon : This can be defined as the way of wrapping the methods and attributes in one single space.
-->Inheritance : It can be defined as when the base class transfers its properties to the derived class.
               : The base class is also called the parent class and the Derived class is also called the child class.


=======
               : The dervied class is called the child class and the base class is called the parent class.

@Constructor : It can be defined as the funtion that is present in all the classes
               and is called _init()_ function, which is always executed when the class is being
               initiated.
             : Constructor always takes a argument know as self.
             : The self parameter is the reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access
               variables that belong to the class

@Attributes : They can be defined as the varibales that store the data and are also the objects to the class
            : They are of two types:
                (a) Class Attributes-->A variable that is shared by all objects (instances) of a class.
                (b) Object Attributes-->A variable that belongs to a specific object (instance) of a class.
                note : If the class attribute and the object attirbute has the same variable name then
                       object.attirbute>>>>class.attirbute


@Methods : These are the function that belongs to the object and perform operation on the object.
         :  Example : get_marks(),set_marks() etc


@Static Methods: These are the Methods that dont use the self parameter and work at the class level 
               : It includes the Decorater which allows us to wrap another funtion in order to extend'
                 the behaviour of the wrapped funtion , without permanantely Modifying it 

@del Keyword - This is a Keyword that is used to delete the properties of the object or the object itself


@Private attribute and Methods:
-->Private attributes and Methods are only meant to be used within the class and are not   
   accessible from outside the Class
--> To make any varibale or method private just add two underscore infront of the varibale or method 
--> Just add __ in front of the variable and method.
