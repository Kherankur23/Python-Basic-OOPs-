# Python Learning Repository 🐍

Welcome to my **Python Learning Repository**! This repository contains all the Python programs I have written while learning **Python from basics to intermediate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. Each program is designed to help understand a specific concept and practice coding effectively.

## 🚀  Contents

This repository covers the following topics:

### 1. Python Basics
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Comparison, Assignment)
- Input and Output (`input()`, `print()`)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, nested loops)
- Functions (arguments, return values)
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries

### 2. Intermediate Python
- String Manipulations (slicing, formatting, methods)
- List and Dictionary Comprehensions
- Modules and Libraries (`math`, `random`, `datetime`, etc.)
- File Handling (reading and writing files)
- Exception Handling (`try`, `except`, `finally`)

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`) and Destructors (`__del__`)
- Instance and Class Variables
- Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel)
- Polymorphism (method overriding, operator overloading)
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- Special Methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__add__`, etc.)

### 4. Additional Concepts
- Recursion (factorial, Fibonacci)
- Lambda Functions & Map, Filter, Reduce
- Decorators
- File-based mini-projects
